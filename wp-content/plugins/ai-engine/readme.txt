== Chatbot: Your own ChatGPT ==

Are you interested in integrating AI-powered chat functionality to your website? Our chatbot can assist you with that! It's a lightweight and user-friendly tool that utilizes vanilla JS on the frontend, and can be easily added to your site with this shortcode: [mwai_chat]. Although it appears simple, the possibilities are limitless, with a variety of parameters and concepts to explore. Visit our [official documentation](https://meowapps.com/ai-engine/) for more information.

Take your AI capabilities to the next level with finetuning and embeddings. By reusing your website's content and other pertinent information, you can train your AI to better cater to your target audience. AI Engine makes this process simple and straightforward with its user-friendly interface. If you'd like to learn more about finetuning, check out our article: [How to Train an AI Model](https://meowapps.com/wordpress-chatbot-finetuned-model-ai/).

== Generate Content, Images & More! ==

Generating content has never been easier! Simply adjust the parameters to your preference, customize the prompts, and discover the results. Furthermore, you can save your parameters as templates for future use, generate content in bulk, and even produce images. The AI Playground also enables you to create your own custom use cases, such as swiftly acquiring recipes based on your refrigerator's contents or quickly drafting restaurant reviews. With AI Engine, the possibilities are endless, and you can personalize the user interface to suit your needs.

== Boost your WordPress with AI ==

AI Engine offers its own internal API that can be utilized by various plugins. For example, [Media File Renamer](https://wordpress.org/plugins/media-file-renamer/) leverages this API to suggest improved filenames for media files. Additionally, [Social Engine](https://wordpress.org/plugins/social-engine/), a plugin that facilitates post-sharing on social media platforms, can also benefit from AI Engine's capabilities to create accompanying text.

== My Dream for AI ==

I am thrilled about the endless opportunities that AI brings. But, at the same time, I can't help but hope for a world where AI is used for good, and not just to dominate the web with generated content. My dream is to see AI being utilized to enhance our productivity, empower new voices to be heard (because let's be real, not everyone is a native speaker or may have challenges when it comes to writing), and help us save time on tedious tasks so we can spend more precious moments with our loved ones and the world around us.

I will always advocate this, and I hope you do too 💕

== Open AI ==

The AI Engine utilizes the API from [OpenAI](https://beta.openai.com). This plugin does not gather any information from your OpenAI account except for the number of tokens utilized. The data transmitted to the OpenAI servers primarily consists of the content of your article and the context you specify. The usage shown in the plugin's settings is just for reference. It is important to check your usage on the [OpenAI website](https://beta.openai.com/account/usage) for accurate information. Please also review their [Privacy Policy](https://openai.com/privacy/) and [Terms of Service](https://openai.com/terms/) for further information.

== Usage ==

1. Create an account at OpenAI.
2. Create an API key and insert in the plugin settings (Meow Apps -> AI Engine).
3. Enjoy the features of AI Engine!
5. ... and always keep an eye on [your OpenAI usage](https://beta.openai.com/account/usage)!

Languages: English.
